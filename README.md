VisDrone2018-SOT Tooklit for Single-Object Tracking


Introduction

This is the documentation of the VisDrone2018 competitions development kit for single-object tracking (SOT) challenge.

This code library is for research purpose only, which is modified based on the visual benchmark platform of Wu et al. [1]. 

The code is tested on the Windows 10 and macOS Sierra 10.12.6 systems, with the Matlab 2013a/2014b/2016b/2017b platforms.

If you have any questions, please contact us (email:tju.drone.vision@gmail.com).

Dataset

For SOT competition, there are three sets of data and labels: training data, validation data, 
and test-challenge data. There is no overlap between the three sets.

For an input video sequence and the initial bounding box of the target object in the first frame, the challenge requires a participating algorithm to locate the target bounding boxes in the subsequent video frames. The objects to be tracked are of various types including pedestrians, cars, and animals. We manually annotate the bounding boxes of different objects in each video frame. Annotations on the training and validation sets are publicly available.

Evaluation Routines

The notes for the folders:
* The tracking results will be stored in the folder '.\results'.
* The folder '.\trackers' contains all the source codes for trackers (e.g., Staple)
* The folder '.\util' contains some scripts used in the main functions.
* main functions
     * main_running.m is the main function to run your tracker
	
       -put the source codes in ./trackers/ according to the source codes of Staple tracker
	
       -modify the dataset path in ./main_running.m    
	
       -input the method named in ./util/configTrackers.m
	
       -the results with mat format are saved in ./results/results_OPE/
	
     * perfPlot.m is the main function to evaluate your tracker based on the results with mat or txt format. 
       Besides, the visual attributes are defined as same as these in [2].
	
       -modify the dataset path in ./perfPlot.m (re-evaluate the results by setting the flag "reEvalFlag = 1")    
	
       -select a tracker named in ./util/configTrackers.m
	
       -select the rankingType e.g., AUC and threshold
	
       -check the tracking results in ./results/results_OPE/
	
       -the figures are saved in ./figs/overall/

     * drawResultBB.m is the main function used to show the results
	
       -modify the dataset path in ./drawResultBB.m  
	
       -select a tracker named in ./util/configTrackers.m
	
       -check the tracking results in ./results/results_OPE/
	
       -the visual results are saved in ./tmp/OPE/	
    
    
    
SOT submission format

Submission of the results will consist of TXT files with one line per predicted object or MAT files as same as that in [1].
For txt submission, it looks as follows:

    <bbox_left>,<bbox_top>,<bbox_width>,<bbox_height>


       Name	                                Description
    --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      <bbox_left>	    The x coordinate of the top-left corner of the predicted bounding box
   
      <bbox_top>	    The y coordinate of the top-left corner of the predicted object bounding box
      
      <bbox_width>      The width in pixels of the predicted object bounding box 
      
      <bbox_height>     The height in pixels of the predicted object bounding box.


For mat submission, it looks as follows:

     < results: {type = 'rect', res, fps, len, annoBegin = 1, startFrame = 1} >


      Variable	                                   Description
    ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
       <type>	     The representation type of the predicted bounding box representation. 
                         It should be set as 'rect'.
	
       <res>	     The tracking results in the video clip. Notably, each row includes the frame index, 
                         the x and y coordinates of the top-left corner of the predicted bounding box, 
		             and the width and height in pixels of the predicted bounding box.
	
       <fps>	     The running speed of the evaluated tracker, namely frame-per-second.
	
       <len>	     The length of the evaluated sequence.
	
    <annoBegin>	     The start frame index for tracking. The default value is 1.
    
    <startFrame>         The start frame index of the video. The default value is 1.
	
	
The sample submission of the tracker can be found in our website.
